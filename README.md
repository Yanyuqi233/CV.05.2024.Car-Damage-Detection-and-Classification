# (Computer Vision) Car Damage Detection and Classification -- 05/2024

## Motivation and Goal
The **need for accurate vehicle damage assessment in the fleet management and insurance industries** drives our project. Leveraging our team’s expertise in data science and machine learning, we aim to develop robust models using curated datasets from platforms like Kaggle.

## Innovation
Our approach is innovative in several ways. We move beyond binary classification to include multiple classification tasks, categorizing damages into frontal, side, and rear categories for deeper insights. We integrate deep learning models such as DenseNet121, MobileNet-v2, ResNet-50, and CLIP to improve classification accuracy and generalization. Additionally, advanced preprocessing techniques are employed to optimize model performance and avoid overfitting.

## Approches
### Binary classification
Our project comprises two primary tasks: binary classification to distinguish between nondamaged and damaged cars, and multiple classification to identify the type and location of damages (front, side, rear). For the binary classification task, we compare the performance of DenseNet121, MobileNet-v2, ResNet-50, and CLIP against a baseline model. We conduct rigorous evaluations and metrics comparisons to assess the models’ effectiveness in accurately classifying vehicle damages.
### Multiple classification
In the multiple classification task, we utilize ResNet-50 and CLIP models to categorize damages into different classes. Additionally, we manually relabel datasets to ensure high-quality training data for multiclass classification, emphasizing the importance of data relevance and accuracy in our methodologies.
